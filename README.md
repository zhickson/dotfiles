# Dotfiles

This is my personal dotfiles repository. It is by no means complete or exhaustive,
but includes the primary configuration files for my personal development environment.

These are Mac-specific, and I work on predominantly WordPress and PHP projects.

My current editors of choice are `Neovim` (for the DX and daily file editing) and `Cursor` (for AI, IDE environment and debugging).

Much inspiration was taken from many of the dotfiles repositories on GitHub.
